## Steps to run locally
1. git clone the repo
2. run this code:
3. open frontend dir and install the npm packages with `npm i` || run this script in the terminal: `cd frontend && npm i`
4. open the backend dir and install the npm packages with `npm i` || run this script in the terminal: `cd backend && npm i`
5. After the above steps have been successfully done, run `npm run dev` on both scripts/terminals. 
6. And there you have it, frontend and backend both running on your device locally.
7. Now, click on the URL where the frontend is running (most likely `http://http://localhost:5173`)
8. Paste the YouTube video link you want to download in the input box.
9. Enjoy the breeze of the seas, mate🏴‍☠️🦜
